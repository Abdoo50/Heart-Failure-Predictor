# Heart-Failure-Predictor
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.
## Data Science Full Project 
I have made in this Project:
- data cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Data visualization with Correlation and Data Analysis for all Columns to display relation between all Columns
- Made Machine Learning Model using Variety of algorithms to classify the best algorithm in this case
- also used Hyperparameter Tuning to get better score for our model and Improve the performance of the model
